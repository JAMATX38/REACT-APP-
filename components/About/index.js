        Hello my name is Jaime Martinez and I am a new graduate of University of Texas Coding BootCamp. I am excited to start this new journey in a field that has tons of opportinuty and pushes me to be the 
        best version of my self possible. Let me tell you a little bit about my self!
        </p>
        <p>
        My work journey hasnt always been in the technology field, before I started Coding Bootcamp I worked in the Natural/Organic Food Industry for 20years. I started at the bottom closing the meat department at my local supermarket and before I changed careers I was the Fresh Director for Wheatsville Food Co-Op.
